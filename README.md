# SIT-5G-Network-QoE-Analysis-with-ML-and-Time-Series-Tools

This repository contains the code, data, and methodologies for a data-driven framework to assess 5G network Quality of Service (QoS). The project compares the performance of SITâ€™s private 5G network with commercial operators (M1 and Singtel) using real-world testing, advanced time-series analysis, and machine learning techniques.

Key Features:
- Predict KPIs like RSRP and RSRQ using machine learning models (e.g., Regression, SVM, ARIMA, and CNN).
- Perform geolocation of base stations using scanner data.
- Identify network anomalies and optimize performance through trend visualization.
- Analyze comparative QoS to highlight strengths and areas for improvement.
- This repository aims to provide actionable insights for 5G network optimization and support future research in QoS benchmarking.
